          <ul id="Greirat_col" class="collapse in">
           <li data-id="sidequest_2_1">Initially locked in a cell, below the Tower on the Wall bonfire in High Wall of Lothric. You can find the Cell Key inside of the workshop below the Pus of Man which erupts on the rooftop. After heading down the ladder and defeating the Lothric Knight, follow the stairs at the end of the hall down to the base floor. Several Starved Hounds and Hollow Soldiers will be patrolling the area. The key is located at the back wall, down a flight of stairs which leads to a Starved Hound and eventual dead end.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_2_2">After accepting his request he appears at the Firelink Shrine as a vendor, asking you to remember about his request when talked to.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_2_3">You can find Loretta's Bone past the Undead Settlement bonfire. It is on a corpse hanging from the balcony of the first house the player will enter, overlooking a congregation in front of a bonfire.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_2_4">After delivering Loretta's Bone, he will ask for permission to scavenge for more items. He will return following the next boss kill and returns as early as after Curse-Rotted Greatwood.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_2_5">You must visit the Undead Settlement after sending Greirat on his first mission to trigger him to leave the Fire Shrine.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_2_6">The trigger to get Greirat's second scavenging quest is crossing the bridge between the Catacombs and the Boreal Valley.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_2_7">After encountering Patches at the Cathedral of the Deep, you can find Siegward - armorless and stuck in a well outside the Cleansing Chapel Bonfire. If you did buy the armor from Patches, you'll need to throw it down to Siegward to get his mojo back. He'll escape on his own, and also rescue Greirat off-screen before meeting you again in the kitchen of the Distant Manor in Irithyll. Do not yet proceed towards the Irithyll Dungeon, because if you do, Siegward of Catarina will leave Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, and will not be around for saving Greirat's life - if you do, Greirat would die upon vanquishing another boss.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_2_7">He will request to leave for a third time to Lothric Castle. He will die if he goes; there is no way to save him. Patches will ask where Greirat went, but this only causes Patches to disappear for a time. Patches will return later and add one Hidden Blessing to his shop inventory, while failing to save Greirat. Greirat's Ashes can be found on the roof at the Grand Archives, after jumping down where you see a group of Corvians. Giving Greirat's Ashes to the Shrine Handmaid will allow her to sell Exploding and Splintering Bolts.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3 id="Hawkwood"><a href="#Hawkwood_col" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-collapse btn-sm"></a>Hawkwood<span id="sidequest_totals_3"></span></h3>
         <ul id="Hawkwood_col" class="collapse in">
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_1">Encountered at Firelink Shrine.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_2">Heavy Gem after talking to him once the Curse-Rotted Greatwood or Crystal Sage is slain.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_3">Farron Ring after talking to him once the Abyss Watchers are slain.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_4">After defeating the Abyss Watchers, Curse-Rotted Greatwood and the Crystal Sage, Hawkwood leaves the shrine. If you talk to Blacksmith Andre after Hawkwood leaves, you will recieve Hawkwood's Shield that he left for you.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_5">You will find him next to summon in the Consumed King's Garden.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_6">After that he appears as a White Phantom Sign, just by the third bonfire in Archdragon Peak. It shows him going up to the shrine and praying before vanishing again.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_7">After obtaining the Twinkling Dragon Torso Stone, he will leave a message with Blacksmith Andre, asking you for a duel.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_8">He will appear in the Abyss Watcher arena and will duel you for the torso stone. If he kills you, he takes it. If you kill him, you get the Twinkling Dragon Head Stone. If he kills you and takes your Twinkling Dragon Torso Stone, you can get it back by killing him.</li>
           <li data-id="sidequest_3_9">You can later find his shield at the graveyard outside firelink shrine.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3 id="Leonhard"><a href="#Leonhard_col" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-collapse btn-sm"></a>Ringfinger Leonhard<span id="sidequest_totals_8"></span></h3>
         <ul id="Leonhard_col" class="collapse in">
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_1">After reaching the second Bonfire at the High Wall of Lothric, Leonhard can be found leaning against Holy King Lothric's throne in Firelink Shrine. Speaking to him will grant you five Cracked Red Eye Orbs.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_2">After obtaining 1 Pale Tongue, and lighting the Cliff Underside bonfire or defeating the Curse-Rotted Greatwood in the Undead Settlement, Leonhard will give you the Lift Chamber Key to the locked door below the Tower on the Wall bonfire.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_3">At the Tower on the Wall bonfire head down two levels and open the locked gate. Take the lift down and defeat the Darkwraith to obtain the Red Eye Orb.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_4">Speak to Leonhard again at Firelink Shrine after obtaining the Red Eye Orb.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_5">Ask to join the Rosaria´s Fingers in Rosaria's Chamber and offer at least 1 Pale Tongue to Rosaria. Do NOT rank up in Rosaria's Fingers until after you have obtained the Black Eye Orb or it may break the questline. That or there are unspecified triggers for Leonhard to kill Rosaria.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_6">Reload the area and then speak to Leonhard at Rosaria's Chamber (over by the entrance to the chamber) and exhaust his dialogue then offer 1 more Pale Tongue's to Rosaria.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_7">After defeating Yhorm the Giant, return to Rosaria's Chamber and pick up the Black Eye Orb in front of Rosaria's corpse.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_8">Go to Gwynevere's bed chamber, above the Aldrich of the Deep bonfire.  Here you will receive a prompt to use the Black Eye Orb to invade Leonhard.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_8_9">If you kill him here he will drop his hat (Silver Mask), Soul of Rosaria (use to revive her or to purchase Bountiful Sunlight miracle from Ludleth at Firelink Shrine), and the Crescent Moon Sword.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Siegward"><a href="#Siegward_col" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-collapse btn-sm"></a>Siegward of Catarina<span id="sidequest_totals_4"></span></h3>
        <ul id="Siegward_col" class="collapse in">
          <li data-id="sidequest_4_1">You can find Siegward of Catarina at Undead Settlement. He will be located just past Eygon of Carim, and he will be coming up the lift. After speaking with him and exhausting his dialogue, he will move to a ledge nearly at the top of the lift. You can roll off if timed right and speak with him again. Help him fight the Fire Demon here to get some gestures and a Siegbrau. (NOTE: If you didn't talk to him when you first saw him on the elevator, he will despawn. However, if you go to the Fire Demon, his dialogue will appear, and he will join you to fight the demon. If you die during the fight he will spawn again. If he dies during the fight, he will not respawn).</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_4_2">Next, he will be found in a well outside of the Cathedral of the Deep's Cleansing Chapel bonfire, which is located right when leaving. You must open the big double blue doors across from Rosaria's Bedchamber Bonfire leading out to the graveyard before you can speak with him (these doors can be accessed by either using the golden lever in front of Rosaria's Bedchamber bonfire, or by using an elevator to the left of the boss fog gate). Reload the area, then speak with him. Obtain his armor from Unbreakable Patches Then return it to Siegward in the well. (In Ng+ if Seigward helped in the fight with Yorhm the armor attained afterwards can be used as a replacement to the armor that Patches sells)</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_4_3">After saving him from the well, he can be found in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, through a small sewer connected to the lake near the Distant Manor bonfire, resting by a fireplace. He has made some Estus Soup and toasts with the player again. You can get gestures here if you missed them in the first encounter (Toast and Sleep). Note: He does not appear here if you have entered Irithyll Dungeon, instead his quest-line continues at the next location. However if you don't meet him there he doesn't join you for the Yhorm fight. (This is actually not entirely true. You can still make it to Profaned Capital and return to find him at this spot. It seems as if he has not moved on to the next encounter)</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_4_4">In Irithyll Dungeon, make your way to a pit full of rats and a sleeping giant standing in the pit.  There is a dungeon cell window, where you can find Siegward locked up. You need to free him. Be careful of the rats while talking to him, as they respawn many times. (you do not need to talk to him to save him) To get to his cell door, head to the Profaned Capital bonfire area. Take the ladder down and bypass some rubble, a Headless Gargoyle will show up right before a series of narrow corridors. Go through the corridors and be careful not to fall through the holes in the floor. You will emerge to find a church located in a swamp. The church is surrounded by Sewer Centipedes and the sticky water causes Toxic buildup. Take the ladder on the right of the church and make your way to the roof of the church. On top of the roof is Logan's Scroll. From the roof towards the stairs, there is an open window in the wall that you need to jump through. You will have to jump from the roof to enter, and it leads to the cell. Using the Old Cell Key frees him and nets you a Titanite Slab. You'll also find Covetous Gold Serpent Ring in his cell.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_4_5">After saving him from his cell, upon entering the fog wall that leads to Yhorm the Giant, a cutscene will trigger with Siegward walking along side the player into the boss arena. He will not join you in the fight with Yhorm if you skipped an encounter with Siegward, but you can still get the Titanite Slab at the end: the only requirement is that you save him from the well.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_4_6">If Yhorm is killed, before freeing Siegward from his cell, returning to the Yhorm boss arena will have another Storm Ruler on the floor, the armor set is apparently lost in this case.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_4_7">Upon talking to him one final time after Yhorm is slain, the conversation after Yhorm leads to him making a toast and then taking a nap. If you proceed to walk towards the bonfire without resting at it, and continue onwards towards the throne, he will collapse behind you and leave his gear behind for you to pick up. (If he does not collapse after walking to the throne, walking towards the door should yield the same results).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="AnriA"><a href="#AnriA_col" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-collapse btn-sm"></a>Anri of Astora - Slayer of Aldrich Ending<span id="sidequest_totals_5"></span></h3>
        <ul id="AnriA_col" class="collapse in">
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_1">You can find Anri at the Halfway Fortress bonfire in Road of Sacrifices. Speaking to them and Horace will unlock the Blue Sentinels Covenant.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_2">After defeating the Deacons of the Deep Anri and Horace will appear at the Firelink Shrine. After talking with Anri in the Firelink Shrine they will head towards the Catacombs of Carthus.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_3"> Anri can be found twice in the Catacombs of Carthus. Talk to Anri just before the staircase with the rolling Skeleton Ball there is a room with two large skeletons wielding giant curved swords. Defeat the skeletons and find a path leading down. The path will be on the right side if you have your back towards the Skeleton Ball. Anri will be in the corner lamenting the absence of Horace.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_4">Talk to Anri a second time talong a rocky path in the room with the collapsable wooden bridge. After bypassing several minor skeletons (beware, a small army of them rises when you make your way towards the bridge) go past the bridge instead of crossing it. There is a ledge to the left offering an alternative path across the chasm. Do not jump off the lege and instead continue right to find Anri at the end of this path. She will still be looking for Horace.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_5">Head across the bridge and attack the posts anchoring it to the cliff. After the animation completely ends the bridge will function as a ladder. Climb down the collapsed bridge, kill the Fire Demon or run past it and head into Smouldering Lake. Once you've made it to the lake hug the right wall and look for an alcove. Horace is inside here, and he will be aggressive.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_6">Kill Horace.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_7">Go back to Anri in the Catacombs to tell them that you found Horace in the Smouldering Lake. After this, Anri presumably leaves to go look for Horace in the Smouldering Lake. Anri will still be in the Catacomb's second location after you have killed High Lord Wolnir, but progressing into the Valley, or waiting for awhile, may cause her to leave.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_8">If Horace is dead, Anri will give you the Ring of the Evil Eye. She will progress to the Church of Yorksha, where she will tell you that she never found Horace.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_9">Kill the pilgrim in the corner of the room at the Church of Yorshka bonfire, (they are disguised as one of the statues in the corner of the room). The pilgrim will drop the Chameleon spell and Anri's summoning sign will appear in front of the Pontiff Sulyvahn's boss room (to the right if facing away from the fog gate, on a little pathway, ending with a pillar.) Note: Killing the pilgrim causes Yuria's questline to fail.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_5_10">Anri's summoning sign will appear in front of large, golden door in Anor Londo, to the left while facing it from outside. Using this sign will cause you to be summoned as a phantom to help them kill Aldrich. This fight can be attempted any number of times, regardless of either your death or Anri's. After killing Aldrich together, you can talk to Ludleth to receive Anri's Straight Sword they left for you. After receiveing the sword from Ludleth you can find hostile Anri where you killed Horace in Smouldering Lake (if you told Anri about what happened to him), or up on the hill where you find the Crest Shield near the Cathedral of the Deep bonfire (again, hostile) if you didn't tell her about Horace (same spot as Crest Shield).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="AnriB"><a href="#AnriB_col" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-collapse btn-sm"></a>Yoel/Yuria/Anri of Astora - Usurp the Flame Ending<span id="sidequest_totals_7"></span></h3>
        <ul id="AnriB_col" class="collapse in">
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_1">Find Yoel of Londor near the Foot of the High Wall bonfire. Recruit him and talk to him at the Firelink Shrine (to the left of the blacksmith at the end of the hall).</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_2">Request his "strength" by allowing him to level you up. Do this 5 times. You can level up once after every 2 deaths. Make sure to do this before defeating The Abyss Watchers. Also, do NOT cure your dark sigils at any point in the game; it is fine to cure hollowing (the stat) through purging stones and the statue, but you must always have the five dark sigils in your inventory.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_3">Find Anri of Astora at the Halfway Fortress bonfire. Exhaust all dialogue. Speak to them again at the Firelink Shrine bonfire after defeating Deacons of the Deep and before defeating Abyss Watchers. </li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_4">Find them in the Catacombs of Carthus in a hallway before the first rolling skeleton ball. Exhaust all dialogue. Choose dialouge options "no" and "do nothing." Do not tell Anri of Horace's whereabouts at any point before killing Horace. Doing so will get Anri killed.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_5">Enter Smouldering Lake and defeat Horace in the cave. When you enter Smouldering Lake, hug the right wall until you get to a cave. Horace will have hollowed and will now be hostile. Kill him. After killing Horace, it does not matter weather or not you tell Anri of his whereabouts as they cannot be killed by Horace. You can now speak to Anri again on the ledge above the wooden bridge before the High Lord Wolnir boss.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_6">If you do not talk to Anri in the catacombs, they will eventually leave for the church as long as you kill Horace before he kills Anri. The turning point is whether or not you kill the Pilgrim in the next step.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_7">Find Anri again at the Church of Yorksha bonfire. Exhaust all dialouge. DO NOT kill the pilgrim in the corner of the room when talking to Anri at the Church of Yorshka bonfire. Doing so will void the ending.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_8">After defeating Pontiff Sulhyvan and opening the path to Anor Londo, speak to Yuria at the Firelink Shrine. Use the talk option and exhaust all dialogue. If done correctly, she will tell you your spouse awaits you in the Temple of the Darkmoon.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_9">Perform the "wedding" ceremony. The tomb is located behind a false statue in the room before you get to the rotating tower in Anor Londo (and after the bow knights). Talk to the pilgrim NPC there and accept the sword. Use the sword on your spouse at the end of the temple and recieve the dark sigil.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_10">Afterwards talk to Yuria one last time at the Firelink Shrine. She will congratulate you on your ceremony and tell you that when the time is right, take the fire instead of linking it. Note: You can return to the tomb and pick up Anri's Straight Sword. NOTE: You can exit and reload after performing the ritual to save a trip back. Be sure to grab the spell off the Pilgrim that gave you the sword as well. </li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_7_11">Defeat the final boss and touch the bonfire. Enjoy the cutscene.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="Sirris"><a href="#Sirris_col" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-collapse btn-sm"></a>Sirris of the Sunless Realms<span id="sidequest_totals_1"></span></h3>
        <h4>Handing in a Pale Tongue to Rosaria at any point before completing this questline will fail the questline.</h4>
        <ul id="Sirris_col" class="collapse in">
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_1">Speak with Sirris of the Sunless Realms in Firelink Shrine after you speak to Horace and Anri of Astora.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_2">Find and give the Dreamchaser's Ashes to the Shrine Handmaid in the Firelink Shrine.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_3">Speak with Sirris at Firelink Shrine and gain the Darkmoon Loyalty Gesture.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_4">Kill the Sullyvahn's Beast at the bridge near the Irithyll of the Boreal Valley bonfire. Reload the world and find her summon sign in the middle of the bridge. Use it to be summoned into her world and help her kill Creighton the Wanderer. (If Sirris' summon sign does not appear killing the Curse-rotted Greatwood boss will make it appear)</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_5">Talk to her at Firelink Shrine to receive a Blessed Mail Breaker and the Silvercat Ring.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_6">After defeating Aldrich, use the summon sign near the Curse-Rotted Greatwood boss area to be summoned into her world and help her kill Hodrick.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_7">When you return to your world, you'll notice the entire boss chamber has collapsed and you can drop down into the pit without taking any fall damage. Holy Knight Hodrick's armor (the Sunset Armor set) will be right by the Pit of Hollows bonfire and the Sunset Shield will be at Hodrick's grave. Both can be obtained before talking to her.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_8">Speak with her for the final time at Firelink Shrine, and she will swear fealty to you. If you decline her offer she can be found hollowed in the Pit of Hollows. She will not fight back if you choose to kill her after accepting her vows and it won't count as a sin.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_9">While speaking with her in firelink shrine, she says that she can die in peace. Hodrick's grave is between Firelink Shrine and the Iudex Gundyr bonfire, where the hollow standing at the edge of the cliff can be found. The Sunset Shield can be found on his body. NOTE: You may need to log out and then back in for it to appear.</li>
          <li data-id="sidequest_1_10">After defeating the Twin Princes her corpse can be found at her grandfather's grave containing the Sunless Talisman and her armor can now be purchased at the Shrine Handmaid.</li>
